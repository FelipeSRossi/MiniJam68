# MiniJam68
 Made  in 72 hours for Mini Jam 68: Sleep. Limitation was that the game should not contain any text.
 
  Developed using Unity Engine, it's a 3 lane combat game inspired by the likes of "The Battle Cats". Can be played online at [itch.io](https://felipesrossi.itch.io/paper-nightmares)
  Done together with [Jansen Moreira](https://github.com/jansenmoreira/)
